# Worklog 2026-02-04

- Branch: `feature/rizzoma-core-features`
- BLB toolbar visibility now tied to expanded state (collapsed rows never render toolbars).
- Playwright BLB snapshot harness rerun: `node test-blb-snapshots.mjs` (new set `snapshots/blb/1770164188794-*`).
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` for the toolbar visibility fix and snapshot refresh.
