# Links Navigation & UX

Goals: navigate to linked blips/waves; batch manage links; keep UI responsive.

- WaveView: click incoming/outgoing to navigate (router hash, focus)
- Keyboard support for following links
- Batch delete outgoing links; confirm dialogs
- Server tests for links endpoints; client smoke tests
- Perf: debounce link refresh on socket events
- Docs/screenshots; risks/rollback
