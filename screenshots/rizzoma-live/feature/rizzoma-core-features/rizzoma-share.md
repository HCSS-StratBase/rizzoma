- **What’s shown:** Wave share controls for “HCSS Rizzoma Business Topic” (legacy UI) opened via Share button; illustrates topic privacy/share settings in the classic client.
- **Modern comparison:** Modernized UI should expose share/permissions via updated modals and event logging; use this as parity reference.
- **Notes:** Dialog appeared; content matches legacy CoffeeScript sharing affordances.
