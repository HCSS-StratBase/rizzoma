- **What's shown:** Share modal dialog displaying sharing options with URL field (https://rizzoma.com/topic/37e9c3bb571376fac643...), privacy settings (Private/Anyone with the link/Public on the web), and social sharing buttons (Facebook, Twitter, Google+).
- **Modern comparison:** Modern sharing UI should provide equivalent privacy controls and link sharing functionality, though social platform buttons may need updating.
- **Notes:** Shows three privacy levels - Private (only listed participants), Anyone with the link (link sharing), and Public on the web (searchable). Note: This file appears to be a duplicate of the share modal.
