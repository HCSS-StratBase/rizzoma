- **What's shown:** Mind map view toggle active in the legacy UI for "HCSS Rizzoma Business Topic" showing collapsed/condensed topic outline with expand buttons (+) next to each item (Oneliner, Relevant links, New to Rizzoma, Description, HCSS Topics) in a hierarchical tree structure.
- **Modern comparison:** Modern client should support mind-map visualization or a comparable view switch; use this for layout/reference parity.
- **Notes:** Shows the structured outline view with collapsible sections, providing an alternative to the full text view.
