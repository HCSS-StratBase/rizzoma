- **What's shown:** Legacy view toolbar visible on the blip in `/0_b_6hb4_8af27/` with nested content expanded, showing the introductory tutorial flow and "Write a reply" interface. View toolbar contains (left to right): Edit, Collapse, Expand, Link, checkbox with 'Hidden', trash can, and Gears (which reveals Copy comment, Copy link, and Playback menu items when clicked).
- **Modern comparison:** Modern view mode should render equivalent content hierarchy and reply affordances with updated styling, plus equivalent toolbar controls for content management and expansion/collapse functionality.
- **Notes:** Captured in view mode; shows expanded nested content structure with tutorial instructions and complete view toolbar functionality.
