- **What's shown:** Same blip in `/0_b_6hb4_8af27/` immediately after clicking the visible `Edit` control in the legacy toolbar. The blue editing toolbar is active with full formatting controls. Edit toolbar contains (left to right): Done, Back, Forward, Link, Add attachment, Add image, Bold, Italics, Underline, Strikethrough, Text background color, Remove formatting, Bulleted list, Numbered list, checkbox with 'Hidden', Trash can, and Gears (which reveals Copy comment, Copy link, and Playback menu items when clicked).
- **Modern comparison:** Modern editor should mirror this edit toggle and expose equivalent edit controls/shortcuts with comprehensive formatting toolbar.
- **Notes:** Captured by clicking toolbar `Edit` (left-click) after load; shows complete editing toolbar functionality with rich text formatting options.
