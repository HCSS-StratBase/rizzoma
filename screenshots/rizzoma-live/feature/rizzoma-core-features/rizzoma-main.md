- **What’s shown:** Logged-in view of the “HCSS Rizzoma Business Topic” wave (`/topic/37e9c3bb571376fac643657bc01a9879/0_b_6hb4_51pf2/`) with topic nav on the left (“Topics/Mentions/Tasks/Publics/Store/Teams/Help”) and the wave content in the main pane.
- **How it compares to modernized implementation:** This is the legacy CoffeeScript UI (classic toolbar, left navigation, right-hand participant/presence indicators). Modernized front-end is expected to have React/Vite surfaces; this capture is for parity reference.
- **Notable UI elements captured:** top toolbar (wave actions), left navigation, unread counts, wave title, participant presence chip, message thread.
