- **What's shown:** Invite modal dialog showing contact list with user avatars and email addresses (Xenia Wickett, Ihor Todorow, Lukasz Waga, benzweibelson@gmail.com, Bianca Barbu, PGF.Hoefsloot@mindef.nl, *Hobbit*) and "Refresh my Google contacts" button for adding participants to the wave.
- **Modern comparison:** Modern invite UI should provide equivalent contact selection interface with Google contacts integration and user search capabilities.
- **Notes:** Captured with invite modal open, showing populated contact list from Google contacts integration.
