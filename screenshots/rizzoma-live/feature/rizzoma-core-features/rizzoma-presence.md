- **What’s shown:** Main wave view with participant/presence indicators in the classic UI (right side), alongside the active topic content.
- **Modern comparison:** Presence chips/avatars should be mirrored in the modernized client; this capture shows legacy placement and styling.
- **Notes:** Presence area visible; overall wave layout unchanged from CoffeeScript client.
