- **What’s shown:** Right-pane replies fully expanded in the legacy “HCSS Rizzoma Business Topic” by repeatedly clicking “Show replies,” revealing nested blips.
- **Modern comparison:** Modern client should similarly support expanding all replies/threads; use as parity for nested content visibility.
- **Notes:** Captured after multiple “Show replies” clicks until no further expansion was available.
